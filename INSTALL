This file contains very brief instructions on how to install and activate
this plugin on SqueezeCenter.

1. Make sure you're running Linux, and you've enabled inotify support within
your kernel.

2. Make sure you are running SqueezeCenter 7.0 or later - this plugin does
not support earlier versions.

3. Make sure you have Linux::Inotify2 installed in your Perl installation (it's
available through CPAN). I developed and tested this with Linux::Inotify2-1.1.

4. Extract the tar file (being sure to preserve the paths in the tar file), and
copy the resulting AutoRescan directory to your SqueezeCenter plugins
directory. The actual installation location differs depending on the Linux
distribution in usem, but it's likely to be something like:
/usr/local/squeezecentre/Plugins

5. Restart SqueezeCenter to make sure it has seen the new plugin.
How to do this differs depending on your Linux distribution, but will be something like the command '/etc/init.d/squeezecentre restart'. Alternatively, just reboot the server.

6. Make sure the plugin is present and enabled on the 'Server Settings/Extras'
page on the SqueezeCenter web interface.

7. Examine and alter the plugin's settings on the 'Server Settings/Advanced' page on the SqueezeCenter. However, the default settings should be fine.
