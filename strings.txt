SETUP_PLUGIN_AUTORESCAN_DELAY_DESC
	EN	This setting controls the amount of time after a change is detected that a rescan of the modified folders will be performed. It doesn't matter if multiple files are being copied, or that the copy may take longer than this time, since the plugin will perform another rescan if additional changes were made. This setting therefore just helps to avoid more scans than necessary and can be safely left at the default.
